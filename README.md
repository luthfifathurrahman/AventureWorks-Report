# AventureWorks-Report

In this project I created comprehensive sales reports from AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company, transforming raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards to track KPIs, compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers. This dashboard contains Sales Report of AdventureWorks Cycles from 2015 to 2017.

I got this dataset from a course on Udemy, here is the link from Udemy:
